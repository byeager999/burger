Eat the Burger app

The Eat the Burger app allows a user to enter the burger of their choice.  Once the burger's name is entered and submited the burger's name will appear on the "Burger Menu" section.  Should the user click the "86" button next to the burger name that burger will then be moved to the "86 List" section.  Once on the "86 list" the user has the option to delete the burger or "Remove from Menu".  This will remove the burger from the 86 list and from the database.

Behind the scenes when a burger is added it is added to the mysql burger_db and the devoured state is set to "false" or "0".  When the user clicks the "86" button the devoured state is changed to "true" or "1" in the database.
